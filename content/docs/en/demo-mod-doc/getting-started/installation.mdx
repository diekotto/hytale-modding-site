# Installation

This guide will walk you through installing the Pokemon mod on your Hytale server.

## Prerequisites

1. Numbered list of prerequisites

## Installation Steps

### 1. Download the Mod

Download the latest version of the Pokemon mod JAR file from the releases page.

### 2. Place the Plugin

Copy the `pokemon-mod-X.X.X.jar` file to your server's `plugins` directory:

```
hytale-server/
└── plugins/
    └── pokemon-mod-1.0.0.jar
```

### 3. Start the Server

Start or restart your Hytale server. The mod will automatically:

- Create a `plugins/PokemonMod/` directory
- Generate default configuration files
- Initialize the Pokemon database

### 4. Verify Installation

Once the server has started, check the console for the following message:

```
[PokemonMod] Pokemon Mod v1.0.0 has been enabled!
[PokemonMod] Loaded 151 Pokemon species
[PokemonMod] Database initialized successfully
```

If you see these messages, the mod has been installed successfully!

## First-Time Setup

After installation, the mod will create several files in `plugins/PokemonMod/`:

```
plugins/PokemonMod/
├── config.yml          # Main configuration file
├── pokemon/            # Pokemon species definitions
│   └── species/
└── data/               # Player and Pokemon data
    └── database.db
```

### Configuration

Before players can use the mod, you may want to review the [configuration options](/docs/demo-mod-doc/configuration/pokemon-config).
