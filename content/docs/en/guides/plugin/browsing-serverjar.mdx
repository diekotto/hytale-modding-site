Our [patcher](https://github.com/HytaleModding/patcher) tool allows you to easily prepare an environment for exploring the Hytale Server.

## Why?

When you add a compiled jar as a library, IntelliJ only decompiles class by class and doesn't let you search it. For example, you cannot right click some class and then Find Usages. This script will give you a ready to use Hytale server code as a project where you can explore anything you want. 



If anything goes wrong, please ping the author in [this post](https://discord.com/channels/1440173445039132724/1460707397189238785) in the Hytale Modding discord server


## Instructions

If you prefer watching over reading, check out the awesome video walkthrough made by Hyphen45. Note that the written instructions have since been improved, but the process remains the same.

After watching, check out the *Adding HytaleServer as a dependency* section below.

* Clone the repository `git clone https://github.com/HytaleModding/patcher.git`, and enter the directory using `cd patcher`

* Create a Python virtual environment in the `.venv` folder. The command for this varies by platform but it is probably 
one of these: 
  - `python -m venv .venv`
  - `python3 -m venv .venv` (Linux)
  - `py -3.13 -m venv .venv` (Windows)  

  In the last one, specifying the version is recommended if you have multiple Pythons installed.

* Activate the virtual environment:
  - Windows: If you're using normal command prompt, do `".venv\Scripts\activate"` and if you're using PowerShell, do `.\.venv\Scripts\activate`
  - Linux/Mac: `source .venv/bin/activate`
  - From now on, you are running python commands from inside the venv, hence you must use `python` instead of `py` or `python3` to invoke python.

* You should now have `(.venv)` prefixed to the current working dir in the terminal.
 
* Inside the venv, install the dependencies
  - `pip install -r requirements.txt`

* Install these dependencies and ensure they are on PATH:
  - `git` - download from [here](https://git-scm.com/install/) and make sure the `C:\Program Files\Git\cmd\` folder is on your PATH.
  - `java` you need JDK 25 or newer
  - `jar` (comes with JDK inside the bin folder)
  - `mvn` - download from [here](https://maven.apache.org/download.cgi), extract and add the `bin` folder on your PATH

After modifying your PATH, don't forget to close existing terminals and start a new one. Verify that those tools are installed by running these commands: `git --version`, `mvn --version`, `java --version`, `jar --version`.

* Put your HytaleServer.jar in the same root directory of this repo or specify an environment variable `HYTALESERVER_JAR_PATH` with the path to your HytaleServer.jar

Then run this:
```shell
python run.py setup
```

What will it do:
- copy the HytaleServer.jar into `work/download`
  * (on Windows) fix `META-INF/license` name collision
- decompile only the `com.hypixel` package using Vineflower and save the output to `work/decompile`
- set up a Maven project in `hytale-server` with the decompiled code
  * all other libraries the server uses are added into pom.xml and you don't have to worry about them.


You can then open the `hytale-server` folder in your favorite IDE and begin exploring the code. For *IntelliJ IDEA*,
you must first set up the SDK. After opening the project (you can open the `pom.xml` file, IDEA will prompt you to open
the entire project) press Ctrl+Alt+Shift+S and under _Project_ configure *SDK* and *Language level* to **25**.

This decompiled code is likely broken. But it is somewhat usable for exploration. Try Ctrl+Shift+F and search PacketAdapters. Want to figure out where is PlayerSetupConnectEvent constructed? Just find it somewhere then right click and Find Usages, and at the bottom see New instance creation.




## Adding HytaleServer as a dependency

Go into `hytale-server/src/main/java` folder in your terminal (cmd or powershell). Run this command
```shell
jar -f hytale-server-stripped.jar -c com
```

Then run this **from the same folder**: 
```shell
mvn install:install-file -Dfile=hytale-server-stripped.jar -DgroupId="com.hypixel.hytale" -DartifactId=HytaleServer-stripped -Dversion="1.0-SNAPSHOT" -Dpackaging=jar
```

Then, in your plugin project add this dependency and also copy other dependencies from the `hytale-server/pom.xml`.
```xml
<dependency>
    <groupId>com.hypixel.hytale</groupId>
    <artifactId>HytaleServer-stripped</artifactId>
    <version>1.0-SNAPSHOT</version>
    <scope>provided</scope>
    <!-- other dependencies too... -->
</dependency>
```

Congratulations!



## Reloading Maven projects
You may have to reload the maven project sometimes. Here's how to do that:  
![_readme_images/img.png](/assets/reload-maven.png)  
It is located in the "m" icon on the right side:  
![_readme_images/m.png](/assets/maven.png)  
If you don't see it, enable it under View -> Tool Windows -> Maven.
