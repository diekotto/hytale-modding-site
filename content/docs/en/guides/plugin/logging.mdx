One way of logging messages is by using Hytale's own logging class `HytaleLogger`, which extends `com.google.common.flogger.AbstractLogger`. The logs will appear in the same log file that the Hytale server uses to write logs, in the server's log folder `{Hytale's install folder}/UserData/Saves/{World}/logs`.

The logger allows you to add a name to it, when calling `HytaleLogger.get("<logger name>")`. The name of the logger will be added before the log message, so it's more easily identifiable inside the log file.

There is a method `.forEnclosingClass()` that you can use to automatically get the logger for the file you are working in without having to change it everytime. 

An example of how to use the Hytale logging class to log messages, through a static attribute in your plugin's main class:

```java
import com.hypixel.hytale.logger.HytaleLogger;

public class ExamplePlugin extends JavaPlugin {

  public static final HytaleLogger LOGGER = HytaleLogger.forEnclosingClass();

  @Override
  protected void setup() {
    LOGGER.atInfo().log("my example plugin just loaded");
  }
}
```

The logger can then be used anywhere, like this:

```java
ExamplePlugin.LOGGER.atInfo().log("hello world");
```

## Log Levels

All log messages have an associated level. The level can be used to categorize messages and configure how they are logged. Using the default configurations, only messages from `Info`, `Warn`, and `Severe` are printed.

```java
    LOGGER.atInfo().log("Provide high-level information about normal behavior.");
    LOGGER.atWarning().log("Signal a potential problem or a situation that could lead to an error.");
    LOGGER.atSevere().log("A serious error that will prevent things from working as expected.");
```

## Template Arguments

The HytaleLogger uses `printf` style arguments, and should support most of the features and specifiers used by normal string formatting.

```java
final String name = "World";
LOGGER.atInfo().log("Hello %s", name);
// prints: Hello World
```

Here is a quick overview of some of the more commonly used specifiers:

- `%s`: String
- `%d`: Integer
- `%f`: Float/Double
- `%b`: Boolean
- `%c`: Char

## Exceptions and Causes

If your log message has an associated exception or you want to include a stack trace, this can be done by setting the cause.

```java
    catch (IOException e) {
        LOGGER.atSevere().withCause(e).log("Error!");
    }
```
